# Firearm Factory

A Roblox experience where players become firearm architects, crafting custom weapons voxel by voxel.

## Overview

Firearm Factory empowers users to assemble 3D pixel-art firearms on a modifiable mesh using Roblox's [EditableMesh](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/EditableMesh) feature.

## Features

* **Voxel-based gun builder**: Intuitively place, remove, and sculpt blocks on a canvas.
* **Real-time mesh editing**: Seamless design adjustments through EditableMesh integration.
* **Modular architecture**: Clear separation with Flamework controllers and services.
* **React-powered UI**: Dynamic, component-driven editor panels via @rbxts/react.
